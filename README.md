# RPG + Shape Creator

Created basically two different projects due to the extension of the due date.
The correct, final file is Final.cpp

This consists of
1. Shape Creator: 
   This is the first project I worked on, allowing the user to build specified shapes in another file.
3. RPG: 
   This is an RPG that allows the player to play through a mysterious world stuck in a time-loop that the player is meant to break. 
   It also has necessary outFile functionality, just edit the file path to your own device.
   This is the project I spent the most time on.
